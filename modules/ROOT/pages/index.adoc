= Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)

Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) enables you to extract data from documents and do further analysis of the content using Einstein AI capabilities. 

Your data stays inside Einstein and isn't shared with the Large Language Models (LLMs). See xref:about-einstein-ai#gen-ai-and-your-data[IDP and Your Data] for more information.

Use IDP to create Document Actions, multi-step flows that enable you to configure document data extraction and assign human reviewers to assert the results.
