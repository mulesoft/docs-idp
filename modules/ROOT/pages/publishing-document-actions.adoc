= Publishing Document Actions

Publishing a document action to Anypoint Exchange makes it available as an API that you can call from other systems, which enables you to build an automated pipeline for document processing that integrates with other applications. 

Every time you modify a document action and republish it, the version number increases. Consider this behavior when publishing document actions and ensure you call the desired version of the published document action in your integrations.

. Open the document in edit mode either by:
** Creating a new document action.
** Opening an existing document action in view mode and clicking *Open in Builder*.
