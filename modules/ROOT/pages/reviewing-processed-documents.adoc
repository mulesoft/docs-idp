= Reviewing Processed Documents 

After a document is processed, Doc AI can queue it for review if:

* At least one of the extracted values shows a confidence score lower than the threshold defined in the document action for that field.
* A field mark as required is not detected in the document. 

In this case, a user must review the document to verify the values for the conflicting fields. After the review is finished, the result of the extraction becomes available for consumption. 

//You can review documents in the UI or by using the Doc AI API.
